# System Architecture

This repo documents core system architecture of the Storacha protocol and network.

New architectural designs should be proposed through the RFC process in the [RFC Repo](https://github.com/w3s-project/RFC). 

Once finalized, new protocols or protocol changes are documented in the [Spec Repo](https://github.com/w3s-project/specs), while the context and why behind our architecture should be documented here.

The organization of these docs will improve over time. Eventualy, it should be a good onboarding guide to folks joining the Storacha team.
